# Transformers: 
[Simple video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M)

 **Transformers** are a type of deep neural network architecture that takes a sequence of data (such as text), understands how each element in the sequence relates to the others and predicts what comes next.

### How it works

In large language models (LLMs), a transformer understands how words in a sentence relate to each other so it can capture meaning and generate the next word.

> **"The cat sat ..."**

The model does this by separating the sentence into small sections called **tokens** (sections that can be a full word but not always can be section of a word). Then we embed each input token into a vector (a list of numbers) that captures its meaning.


$$
E =
\begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.4 & 0.1 \\\\
0.6 & 0.1 & 0.8 \\\\
0.9 & 0.7 & 0.3
\end{bmatrix}

The = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.4 & 0.1
\end{bmatrix}

cat= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.6 & 0.1 & 0.8 
\end{bmatrix}

sat= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.9 & 0.7 & 0.3
\end{bmatrix}
$$


#### Transformer Blocks



The transformer blocks, decides which token are most relevant to each other (Self-Attention layer) and then refines and transform the information (Feedfoward Neural Network).

##### Self Attention


Each token creates three versions of itself:  
- **Query (Q):** What it’s looking for  
- **Key (K):** What it offers  
- **Value (V):** Its meaning  

$$
Q = XW_Q, \quad K = XW_K, \quad V = XW_V
$$

Then, every word compares its **Query** with every other **Key**:

$$
\text{Scores} = QK^T
$$

Higher scores mean the words are more related. Finally, each word mixes the information from all others using these weights:

$$
\text{Output} = \text{Attention} \times V
$$


#### Feedforward Neural Network + Normalize

After **Self-Attention**, each word’s vector now contains context.  

The **Feedforward Layer** helps the model process that information more deeply using a small two-layer network:

$$
\text{FFN}(x) = \text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
$$

Then, the model adds the original input back to the output (a **residual connection**) and **normalizes** it for stability:

$$
\text{Output} = \text{LayerNorm}(x + \text{FFN}(x))
$$



### Language Modeling Head
After the transformer finishes processing,  
each word has a final **vector** that captures its full meaning and context.  
Now the model needs to turn those vectors into actual **predicted words**.

Each word is now just a list of numbers (a vector) — for example:

| Word | Vector (example) |
|:-----|:----------------:|
| The  | [0.23, -0.11, 0.77, 0.52, ...] |
| king | [0.45, 0.84, -0.31, 0.09, ...] |

These vectors are the **input** to the language modeling head.

---

#### ⚙️ What happens next

The model multiplies these vectors by a large **vocabulary matrix**  
(one row for every possible word it can predict).  
This gives a **score** for each possible next word.

Then it uses **softmax** to turn those scores into **probabilities**  
that add up to 1.

---

#### 🗣️ Output Example

If the model just saw the phrase “The”, it might predict:

| Next Word | Probability |
|:-----------|:-------------:|
| king | 0.65 |
| cat  | 0.18 |
| apple | 0.06 |
| sat | 0.02 |

The word with the **highest probability** ("king") is chosen as the next word.

# Applying:

**Input** : Tiny ShakespeaRe

**Train**
- Run: `python3 training.py`
- Device auto-detects `mps` on Apple Silicon; falls back to `cpu`.
- The script now saves a checkpoint at `assets/checkpoints/gpt-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.pt` and a convenient copy at `assets/checkpoints/latest.pt`.

**Generate**
- After training, sample text with:
  - `python3 sample.py --prompt "ROMEO:" --max_new_tokens 300`
- If needed, specify device: `--device cpu` or `--device mps`.
- To use a specific checkpoint: `--ckpt assets/checkpoints/gpt-20241017-153800.pt`.

Notes
- Prompts should use characters seen during training (Tiny Shakespeare) for best results.
- Checkpoint includes model hyperparameters and the character vocabulary, so generation does not require the training data.

**Resume + Checkpoints**
- Training now saves periodic checkpoints every `--save_interval` steps (default = `eval_interval`).
- Latest checkpoint path: `assets/checkpoints/latest.pt`.
- Resume training:
  - `python3 training.py --resume` (auto picks `latest.pt` if present)
  - Or specify: `python3 training.py --resume --ckpt assets/checkpoints/gpt-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS-step3000.pt`
- Safe interrupt: Press Ctrl+C; the script saves a checkpoint at the next safe point and exits.
